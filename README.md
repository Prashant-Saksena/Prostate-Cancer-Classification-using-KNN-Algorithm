# Prostate-Cancer-Classification-using-KNN-Algorithm
Classification of Prostate cancer using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

We used the 'Elbow method' to find a good value of K with the help of a cross-validation curve using an Error rate.
After determining the best suitable value of K, we used confusion metrics and a classification report to observe the change in the accuracy of our classification.
Finally, we plotted the ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristics)- AUC curve at the best value of K.
